# Coding-Bat-Programming-Exercises

## Synopsis

CodingBat.com is a free site with solvable coding problems to expand and reinforce foundational coding skills for Java and Python. This repository is an archive of the problems I've worked on the site along with my solutions for them. 

CodingBat's focus is the logic and concepts related to acute problem solving rather than building the entire application with multiple methods etc. 

CodingBat Problems are divided into programming langauge and type of problems.

## Motivation

Part of my assigned work at the Arkansas Coding Academy included Java CodingBat exercises. However, we were encouraged to go beyond just the required work and push ourselves with harder problems and categories. 

I began doing Python exercises on my own later on. I wanted to become familiar with the basics of a new language and test my ability to adapt to the change in logic and syntax. I'm still working through Python's problems and plan to eventually complete them all.


## Installation

To see my solutions implemented and ran, follow the link commented above the problem's description and copy and paste the solution, finally run it.

## Tests

CodingBat is modular, in that you simply develop the method to solve the problem and click run. 

After doing so, the site runs the code through numerous testing parameters to verify it works universally.
